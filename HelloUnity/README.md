## Gaze control

I wasn't able to achieve the gaze control demonstrated on the assignment webpage. However, the control I made is able to make sure that the eyes focus on the object, but the orientation of the head is random. I followed the instruction for the rotation formulation based on tangent, but I must have done something wrong.

- Update:

The gaze control was fixed!

## Two link controller

I wasn't able to achieve the gaze control demonstrated on the assignment webpage. However, the elbow control I made was working correctly. I followed the instruction for the rotation formulation based on tangent, but I must have done something wrong.

I wasn't able to save my character because it returns a error message "You are trying to save a Prefab with a missing script. This is not allowed. Please change the script or remove it from the GameObject 'Accessory_SpineRibbon_00'." I don't think I have added this to my character.

In my BehaviorUnique script, the bunnies act as guards. When the skeleton gets close enough towards the home area, the bunnies will shoot balls towards the skeleton. When the skeleton is not around, they will look towards the player if the player is close enough to them. Otherwise, the bunnies will look around randomly.
