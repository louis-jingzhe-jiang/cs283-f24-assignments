# Danger Zone Game

## Proposal

I would like to implement a game which is similar to a first-person horror game that you need to keep away from several monsters and reach a destination. I decided to rebuild the whole scene for this project. The scene for this game will be similar to a maze, with different pathways from the home area to the destination. Multiple monsters of different kinds (at most 3 different kinds of monsters with different behaviors) will be blocking the player from reaching the destination. The player may probably need to lure the monster away from their spawning point in order to go forward. There will be some pathways that monsters cannot enter but the player can. The player needs to find a key in the scene in order to enter the destination. The player will have a health system, which will be shown in UI. The game should have different sound effects (such as monsterâ€™s footstep, growl, etc.).
